# Printable Piano Notes

I'm learning piano and couldn't find any notes I could print, cut and stick to my keys. So I made some and use a little script to add them to a printable A4 sheet.

You can find the individual printable notes in the notes folder. For all the notes ready to be printed, use the printable-piano-notes.png file.

Currently, I made it for my 61 key keyboard but I can make more if there's demand ;) just give me a shout.

Enjoy!
